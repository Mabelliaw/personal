      <h3>Design & Development</h3>
      <p> I taught myself to code, from an online coding bootcamp course Udemy.
        I’m a big fan of “do what you are passionate about”.
        It looks cliché, but it always worked for me.
        When I started with programming with no knowledge, but with this inner motivation;
        Passion, interest and disciplined throughout my learning journey, I have gain so much.
